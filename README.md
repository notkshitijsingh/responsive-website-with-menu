# Responsive Website with Effects
This is a project that uses vanilla HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript to make a website that is responsive with a desktop view and a mobile view, and some animations for elements like dropboxes and sidebars on the respective platforms.

The inspiration for the design of the website was heavily inspired by a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation-ryaPetHE5/hub/intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation-l4nZj6wWDe) challenge.
